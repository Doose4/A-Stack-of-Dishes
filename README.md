# A-Stack-of-Dishes
    Background
Write a stack data structure that stores Dish objects. Like the post linked above, you can use an array “under the hood”, meaning that your stack will have a maximum size.

        Getting Started
    Prerequisites
1. C++ v14
2. Visual Studio

    Set Up
1. Copy the repository.
2. Load Code in Visual Studio.
3. Press Run button(or F5).
    
    Running the Test Suite
1. Start the code
2. Test driver automatically starts.
3. Verify all outputs match list

    Running code
1. Start the code

Stack information:
1. The stack can be up to 10 dishes and multiple stacks can be created
2. The stack can have the following options done to it...
    1. push(Dish) = you can add a dish to the stack, as long as the stack is not already full.
    2. pop() = you will remove and see what was on the top.
    3. peek() = look, but not remove, the top dish.
    4. remove() = removes the top dish, essentially.
    5. clear() = removes all the dishes from the stack.
    6. size() = returns the size of the stack.
